                <pre>&#9;</pre>Hello! I am Ahri or A Fluffy Ahri. I am an Artist and Streamer. 
                I have been drawing ever since I was able to hold a pencil. I have a major in Illustration, comic books. 
                My dream is to one day become a successful content creator as well as providing great art.</p>
            <p>
                <pre>&#9;</pre>Many people wondered where I got my name from, and yes it's from a game called League of Legends. 
                League of Legends has a character name Ahri. Ahri is one of my favorite characters that I love to play with. 
                My friends and I would have this rule in our name where we would have "A Adjective Noun" as our names. 
                At the start of my streaming carrer I only wanted to stream League of Legends, but the game became very toxic after 7 years of playing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <pre>&#9;</pre>I have been streaming ever since January 2017. My goal as a Streamer is to grow a nice playful supportive community, and one day become partnered. 
                I stream many different kind of games, from FPS to MOBAs to MMORPG. Anyone is welcomed to come and watch, I love to interact and play with my viewers.
